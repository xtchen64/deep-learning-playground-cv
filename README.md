Deep Learning with MNIST dataset

## Set up:
0. The environment does not use brew or conda.
1. Set up local virtual environment (vscode only). This sets up a venv in the project folder:
- In vscode terminal, make sure you are in the project folder. Create venv by running `python -m venv mnist`
- In vscode, if not prompted to do so, run `command+shift+p`, choose the `mnist` interpreter
- Activate this venv in terminal: `source mnist/bin/activate`
2. Install required packages in terminal: `pip install -e .`
